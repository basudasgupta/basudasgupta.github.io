If you are a graduate student at TIFR and interested in dark matter, neutrinos in astrophysics/cosmology, or some other aspect of astroparticle physics, feel free to drop by my office for a chat! Students from outside TIFR are welcome to email me, but owing to the large volume of such mails I may not be able to reply quickly.

If you would like to do a postdoc at TIFR and work with me, please consider applying for the Visiting Fellows program at DTP and email me to let me know. We are looking for bright motivated postdocs in the area of astroparticle physics and cosmology. Exceptional candidates may be considered for a Prize Postdoctoral position, that comes with an enhanced fellowship and research grant, funded through a Max-Planck Partnergroup.
