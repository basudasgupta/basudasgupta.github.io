###Students
If you are a graduate student at TIFR and interested in dark matter, neutrinos in astrophysics/cosmology, or some other aspect of astroparticle physics, feel free to drop by my office for a chat! Students from outside TIFR are welcome to email me, but owing to the large volume of such mails I may not be able to reply quickly.

###Postdocs
If you would like to do a postdoc at TIFR and work with me, please consider applying for the Visiting Fellows program at DTP and email me to let me know. We are looking for bright motivated postdocs in the area of astroparticle physics and cosmology. Exceptional candidates may be considered for a Prize Postdoctoral position, that comes with an enhanced fellowship and research grant, funded through a Max-Planck Partnergroup.

## Some general advice

If you are considering working with me, you should try to do one of your graduate course projects with me. I am interested in neutrino astrophysics and cosmology, dark matter, and other areas of particle physics (collider physics), astrophysics (stellar evolution, collapse), and cosmology (structure formation, neutrinos). You may also want to have a look at my publication list and my CV.

I have found some of these articles very helpful to gain a perspective about doing research. Perhaps you may find them useful too.

* R. W. Hamming, on “You and Your Research“
* S. Weinberg’s “Scientist: Four Golden Lessons“
* F. Dyson, on “Birds and Frogs“
* Anonymous’, “The secret life of a physicist” 

You may also want to think/read about how to choose an advisor. There is a lot of good information out there (google!). Here is an article I found to be frank and honest:

* B. A. Barres, on “How to Pick a Graduate Advisor“

Although addressed to neuroscience graduate students the advice is remarkably portable (lab rotations  &rarr; projects, NIH  &rarr; national or international grant giving agency, etc.)
