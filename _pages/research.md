The main idea behind most of my work is that many features of stars, galaxies, and the Universe are intimately tied to the behavior of their tiniest constituents, i.e., atoms and subatomic particles. One can discover more about one by studying the other. I use this basic principle to understand stars, galaxies, the early Universe, neutrinos, dark matter, black holes, etc.

### Neutrinos



Neutrinos are fascinating elementary particles with unique properties that make them a useful tool to study astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics. They are crucially important for the evolution of stars and galaxies, and come to us from the depths of these faraway and dense parts of the Universe bearing useful information. Studying these particles have already resulted in major discoveries, including several Nobel prizes, but more excitement is in store!

I work on the physics of supernova neutrinos, high-energy neutrinos from GRBs, AGNs, etc., as well as the impact of neutrinos in cosmology.

### Dark Matter

Dark Matter has been my other main interest. We now know that the Universe is mostly made of invisible stuff whose presence can be inferred through gravitational effects. It is clear that no known particle can play the role of this dark matter, and discovery of the identity of dark matter promises to be a huge breakthrough.

I work on different aspects of dark matter physics, be it possible candidates, mechanisms for their production, various ways to detect them and identify their properties, etc.
