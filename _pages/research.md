The lives of stars, galaxies and the Universe are intimately tied to the behavior of their tiniest constituents, i.e., the elementary particles. One can discover more about one, by studying the other. Exploring the ***astro-particle*** connection requires a little bit of knowledge of a lot of different things. 

In my work I try to learn more about stars, galaxies, the early Universe, neutrinos, dark matter, black holes, etc.
